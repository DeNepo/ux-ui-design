# Co-Design Your Home Page

In this module you will practice the **Double Diamond** approach to development
building a personal home page. You will host the project _on your github
account_ in a repository named _username.github.io_.

There will be 2 phases to the project in UX/UI Design, taken from the **Double
Diamond** approach to design:

## Phase 1: _Design in pairs_

This is the **Discover** & **Define** phases of the Double Diamond design
process. You will be working in small groups to design your home pages,
practicing _stakeholder_ and _user_ interviews.

1. Divide your group into pairs and conduct _stakeholder interviews_ to help
   determine what you need from your home page.
2. Based on the results of that interview, you will work together to define user
   personas, a backlog, and an initial design.
3. Using that design your partner will conduct a _user interview_ with each of
   your remaining group mates.
4. Based on the results of the user interviews, your partner will suggest
   changes to your home page's design.
5. Together you will settle on a design you would like to develop.
6. Retrospect

## Phase 2: _Develop individually_

> You do not need to finish (or even start) this phase during the UX/UI module!
>
> After you have co-designed your page, you can develop it on your own time
> during the JS modules to continue practicing with HTML/CSS.

This is the **Develop** & **Deliver** phases of the Double Diamond design
process. You will be working individually to build the home page your group
helped you design. You are developing your own home page to showcase what you
have learned about HTML & CSS and to have ownership over your online image:

1. Practice building a few sections of the page to get a feeling for how the
   design will work.
2. Set technical constraints for yourself. For example, do you want to use a CSS
   framework or stick with plain HTML & CSS?
3. Write a development strategy for yourself
4. Set up your project board & issues
5. Develop
6. Retrospect

You home page is a never-ending project! You can continuously improve it as you
learn more in the coming months. The goal during this module is only to make a
solid start, not to make everything perfect.

## Checklist

Each person in your group will create _their own_ deliverable issue for the
project board, so there should be one issue per person in your class. You can
label it with `individual` and `group`.
