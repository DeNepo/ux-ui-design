## 1. First Interview

<!--
  Take a few minutes getting to know your partner and their ambitions. Ask questions about:

  - Their background (Professional, programming, personal)
  - Their ambitions (Professional, programming, personal)
  - Outside interests (For tying into a personal statement)
  - And much more ... listen to your partner and ask questions about what they tell you.

  The best way to do your interview is with a lot of `why?`. Start your interview with one or two open-ended questions and follow up with a lot of `why?`, this gives your partner the chance to really explain themselves instead of just answering your questions. You might find that they even learn something about themselves!
-->

### Notes

<!-- Notes you took during the interview. -->

### Summary

<!-- Consolidate your notes into a few sentences. Do your best to express what your partner was trying to say, not what you learned from them. -->

## 2. Follow-Up Interview

<!--
  In this follow up interview you will present to your partner a summary of your first interview. You will do your best effort to understand, rephrase, and communicate your partners needs back to them. Take this chance to listen for their feedback on how well you understand their situation. Update your notes accordingly
