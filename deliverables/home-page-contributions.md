# Home Page Contributions

Learn how to contributing to Open Source projects by sending at least 2 PRs to
your classmate's home pages. A contribution can be as simple as fixing a
spelling mistake or aligning an element.

How is this different than the group projects you worked on in the last module?
You won't be a member of the repository! For this deliverable you will make your
PRs to a project that you did not help to plan and that you do not have access
to. You will need to create a fork and send your PR from there.

Before sending a PR to one of your classmate's home pages, take some time to
read through their planning, project board and code. It's better to understand
their project and make a small contribution you are sure will be helpful than to
propose big changes that do not fit with their ideas.

      contribution_

      contribution_
- ... why stop at 2?
